# Sentiment-Analysis
This Project will show you how to develop a Deep Neural Network for text classification (sentiment
analysis).  Preprocessing using a pre-trained model that converts text into
numeric vectors
Convert text to embedding vectors using the Universal Sentence Encoder model
• Build a hotel review Sentiment Analysis model
• Use the model to predict sentiment on unseen data
